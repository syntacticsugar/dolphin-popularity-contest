# Dolphin Social Network
## Homework for data viz course

1. My data covers "an undirected social network of frequent associations between 62 dolphins in a community living off Doubtful Sound, New Zealand", from (https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/data.php?id=6)  Why?  Because I love dolphins!
1. I used all the data provided in 'dolphins.gml' from (http://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/data/dolphins/dolphins.gml)
1. I'd like to point out that the **green** represents LOW popularity, **purple** represents HIGH popularity, and the gradient shades in the *middle* represent the dolphins in the middle of popularity spectrum.
1. It shows 'Topless' is pretty darn popular!  Well more importantly, it looks like there are two main 'clusters', or 'groups', of dolphins.  I have no idea why this is, or what it would indicate, but if I were to guess, it seems like there are two social 'cliques', and any single dolphin would most likely belong to one or the other.  There are a few dolphins though, that seem to be connected to members of both cliques.
